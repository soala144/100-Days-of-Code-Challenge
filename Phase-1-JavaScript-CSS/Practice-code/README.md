# Day 2: Practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Basics

## Goal:
Set up a basic development environment and practice creating foundational files for web development.

---

## Tasks Completed:
1. **Learned About HTML Structure:**
   - Used `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and other basic tags to structure a webpage.

2. **JavaScript Introduction:**
   - Wrote a basic `index.js` file for adding dynamic behavior to the page.

---

## Key Concepts Learned:
- **HTML:**
  - Understanding the DOM structure.
  - Linking external CSS and JavaScript files.

- **CSS:**
  - Styling elements using selectors.

- **JavaScript:**
  - Using `console.log()` for debugging.
  - Linking JavaScript to HTML for functionality.

---

## Files Created:
1. `index.html`: Contains the structure of the webpage.
2. `style.css`: Provides styles to enhance the visual layout.
3. `index.js`: Contains basic JavaScript to interact with the webpage.

---

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the **Phase-1-Practice** folder.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the setup.

---

## Reflection:
Today’s task was foundational, providing a strong start for more advanced projects in the future phases.

## DAY 4: LOOPS
I learnt about loops and its types how it can be used based on the problem you want to solve and the iteration rule to be applied. i learnt about the for loops, while loops, for.. while loops, do..while loops, for...in loops and for...of loops and their various syntax.

## Day 5: Arrays & Methods

### What I Learned:
- Declared arrays and accessed their elements.
- Used methods like `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.length`, and `.indexOf()`.

### Challenges:
- Understanding the difference between `.pop()` and `.shift()` initially.

### Mini Projects:
- Created a shopping list with various array operations.


## Day 6: Functions and its types
## What I learned:
- Declared the two types of Functions 
- How to use parameters of a function to perform task
- How to use scopes in function
- calling a function into another function

### Challenges : 
- Understanding how to call a function into another

## Mini Projects:
- Create a function to calculate the total cost of items in a cart (price × quantity),    include a discount parameter with a default value.
- Write a function that accesses both local and global variables. Ensure you understand the differences.
- Write a function that filters an array of numbers to return only even numbers. Pass the filtering logic as a separate function

## Day 7: DOM manipulation
## What I learned:
- How to manipulate the dom
- How to change elements in the dom
- How to Change attributes in the dom

### Challenges : 
- Targeting an element with it's class

## Mini Projects:
- To do list

# Day 8: Events and Event Listeners

## Topics Covered:
1. Adding event listeners using `addEventListener`.
2. Handling common events like `click`, `mouseover`, and `keydown`.
3. Understanding Event Propagation:
   - Capturing phase.
   - Target phase.
   - Bubbling phase.
4. Event Delegation for dynamic or multiple child elements.
5. Using `event.stopPropagation()` to control event flow.

## Challenges Faced:
- Differentiating capturing and bubbling phases during event propagation.
- Implementing event delegation efficiently.
- Understanding when and how to stop propagation.

## Mini Projects:
1. **Background Color Toggle:**
   - Created buttons to toggle the background color of the page.

2. **Change Text on Click:**
   - Implemented a button that updates a paragraph's text when clicked.

3. **Event Propagation Demo:**
   - Used nested elements to demonstrate the capturing and bubbling phases.

4. **Event Delegation with List:**
   - Built an interactive list to display content on item selection.
